# Vector Tile List
This is a demo application using the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) to quickly filter Vector Tile layers.

This is a very simple tool that will list the layers and sublayers in a Vector Tiles style file.
This is completely experimental and is meant as an exercise to get familiar with how Vector Tile styles work.
